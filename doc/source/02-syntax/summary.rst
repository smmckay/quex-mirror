Summary
=======

This chapter provided an introduction into Quex's syntax. By explaining the
top-level sections such as `mode`, `define` and `token` the user is now able to
reflect on the basic structure of Quex input files.  He is now ready to dive
into the `demo/` directories.  With the given knowledge and by experimenting
with the provided examples the user might be competent enough to develop his or
her own robust lexer applications.  More about Quex's features and how they may
be used is explored in the coming chapters.
