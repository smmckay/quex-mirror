**************
Quex's Syntax
**************

The generation of lexical analyzers must be based on a specification of a
nominal behavior. Quex expects those specifications to be made in a formal
language stored in input files, usually with the extension `.qx`. The syntax of
this formal language is now discussed in this chapter.  As a basis, the main
sections and their related subjects are explained. This includes considerations
of *pattern definition*, *modes*, *token identifiers*, and *token types*.  A
great part of this chapter deals with regular expressions for the
specification of input patterns.  Two particular entities, namely *modes* and
*tokens*, are presented in great detail in later chapters.
