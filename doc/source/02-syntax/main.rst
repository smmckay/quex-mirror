Syntax
******

Quex generates lexers based on descriptions provided in a formal language.  In
the first section of this chapter the keywords are introduced that separate the
files into main sections. A major part of this section is then concerned with
the syntax of regular expressions, i.e. the syntax that described state
machines.  Two particular entities, namely *modes* and *tokens*, are presented
in great detail in later chapters.
