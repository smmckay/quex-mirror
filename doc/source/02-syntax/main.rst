**************
Quex's Syntax
**************

The specification of lexical analyzers to be generated by Quex are typically
stored in files with the extension ``.qx``. The syntax of those files is
introduced in this chapter.  The first section introduces syntax elements that
divide an input file into main sections such as to define modes token
identifiers, and token types.

Two particular entities, namely *modes* and *tokens*, are
presented in great detail in later chapters.  So, this chapter is restricted to
display basic schemes for the two.  A second section briefly summarizes how
numbers can be specified. A larger third section presents the syntax of regular
expressions including the use of the Unicode database.
