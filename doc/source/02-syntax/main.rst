**************
Quex's Syntax
**************

Lexical analyser specifications are stored in files with the extension ``.qx``.
The syntax of those files is introduced in this chapter.  The first section
introduces syntax elements that divide an input file into main sections such as
to define modes, token identifiers, and token types.  Two particular entities,
namely *modes* and *tokens*, are presented in great detail in later chapters.
A second section briefly summarizes how numbers can be specified. A larger
third section presents the syntax of regular expressions including the use of
the Unicode database.
