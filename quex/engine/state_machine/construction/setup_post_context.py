       ________________________________________________________________________
       This process is very similar to sequentialization. 
       There is a major difference, though:
       
       Given a state machine (e.g. a pattern) X with a post context Y, 
       a match is only valid if X is followed by Y. Let Xn be an acceptance
       state of X and Ym an acceptance state of Y: 

              ---(Xn-1)---->(Xn)---->(Y0)----> ... ---->((Ym))
                            store                       acceptance
                            input
                            position
       
       That is, it holds:

          -- The next input position is stored the position of Xn, even though
             it is 'officially' not an acceptance state.

          -- Ym will be an acceptance state, but it will not store 
             the input position!       

       The analysis of the next pattern will start at the position where
       X stopped, even though Ym is required to state acceptance.
