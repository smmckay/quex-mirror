         A list of pre-context pattern-id pairs. That is something like

              [  (pre-context-id 6, acceptance-id 12),
                 (pre-context-id 4, acceptance-id 11),

        which tells in a prioritized way what to accept under what condition.
        The first pre-context that is fulfilled determines the pattern id of
        the winning pattern. Consequently, any entry after the conditionless
        acceptance is meaningless.
        
        acceptance-id is None => acceptance is restored from the auxiliary register
                                 for acceptance. In that case, the pre-context must 
                                 be 'None', too.

        But, there must be an acceptance associated to no pre-context. So, it

        According to [DOC], it is admissible to return a SUPERSET of what is
        required, which is what happens! 

        The acceptance register is required in any state, since one needs to know
        what pattern wins. A position register can only be important after it has
        received an assignment. Thus, the set of successor states of a state where
        the input position is stored in a register 'X' is a superset of the states
        that require 'X'.

        OVERHEAD ANALYSIS: 

        Overhead appears only with respect to position registers.  It is
        conceivable, that after a position for pattern 'X' has been stored, a
        branch is taken that does not have an acceptance of pattern 'X'. If it
        hits a mouth state, an unused entry action may occur. Otherwise, it 
        has not impact. 
        
        The fact that the branch exists, however, tells that there is another
        pattern must exist that starts with the pattern 'X' (before its
        post-context starts). To hit a mouth state, a third pattern must be involved
        with the same requirement. For example something like

                    1:  [a-z]+/":"
                    2:  [a-z]+":"[a-z]
                    3:  [a-z]+":otto"

        would be such a case. So, ":" would be a delimiter for words, and then
        in second pattern and third pattern, it would not. This seems strange,
        to the author of this code. In any case, the impact would be most
        likely unmeasurable. While the identification of the patterns take lots
        of comparisons, the additional entry operation only appears when
        pattern 3 terminates (after 'otto') and the transition branches into
        the pattern 2 (to match an identifier consisting of letters).

# [X] Rationale for unconditional input position storage.
#
# The sequence 'if pre-context: store' may be translated into:
#
#      COMPARE            pre_context_flag, true
#      IF_NOT_EQUAL_JUMP  LABEL
#      STORE              input_p -> register
#   LABEL: ...
# 
# Thus even in the case that the position is not stored, the cost is: 1 x
# compare + 1 x conditional jump. The cost for always storing the input position
# is: 1x store. Since both involved entities are either on the stack (-> cache)
# or in registers the store operation can be expected to be very fast.
#
# On the other hand, the stored value is only used if the pre-context holds.
# Thus, no harm is done if the value is stored redundantly.
# 
# For the above two reasons, at the time of this writing it seems  rational to
# assume that the unconditional storage of input positions is faster than the
# conditional. (fschaef 14y12m2d)
