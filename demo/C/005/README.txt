 Including files during lexical analysis.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lexical analysis may be interrupted at a particular position in the input 
stream and another input stream may be processed. Quex provides the feature
of an 'input-stack' to deal with these situations.

In this directory an example shows how 'inclusion' is handled with a quex
lexical analyzer.
