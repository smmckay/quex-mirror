Normalization: 

    Define a unique representation for an equivalence

    Many representations --> single representation
                             (1) composition: single character
                             (2) decomposition: multiple characters

    \CompatComp
    \CannonComp
    \CompatDecomp
    \CannonDecomp

Expansion: 

    Define a all representation which are equivalent

    \CompatExp
    \CannonExp

Vowelization
    \WoVow    --> also match without vowels
    \WoVow(p) --> also match partly without vowels
